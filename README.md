# BattleHelper
This repository provides the code for a Pok√©mon Showdown Battle helper tool which can analyze replays, look at all teams posted on Smogon and performs damage calcs on every new matchup!

This project is in a **Beta** phase, so use it with the knowledge that it might break!    
Any issue or merge request is appreciated.

## Installation

1) Install the Tampermonkey Addon here: [Tampermonkey Homepage](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php?ext=dhdg)
2) Select a [battleHelper.js](battleHelper.js) in this repo 
3) View the file and click the Raw button at the top of the file to view its source
4) Copy the source
5) Open Tampermonkey in your browser and click the Add Script tab (icon with a plus symbol)
6) Paste the source into the script window and hit save

## Custom Sets

If you want to include your custom sets in the damage calc, visit [my calc copy site](https://fulllifegames.com/Tools/Calc/) and include your sets here!

## Feedback

As previously said, any feedback or bug report is welcomed in the Issues tab.   
Currently the UI for the Calc Api window is something I want to work on, so any comments on that would be appreciated.
